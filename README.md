## [**Testing**](#testing)

This website is entirely responsive and tested on all browsers and desktop and mobile.

## [**Deployment**](#deployment)

This website was created using Visual Studio Code on a local git directory and then uploaded to GitHub. 
I have made it live using Git pages. To do this, I initiated the git repository with **'git innit'**, then used **'git status'** to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. 
I used **'git commit -m "added in a specific message of main changes"** to commit my changed files to the repository. 
Once my files were committed I used **'git push origin mainBranch'** to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. 
I did this every time I made significant changes to any part of my site.
